# Phaser 3 Webpack Project Template with SASS Complier

A modified version of the [Phaser 3 Project Template](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template) with includes sass compiling configured through webpack. 

### Requirements

We need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to install and run scripts.

## Install and run

Run next commands in your terminal:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install dependencies and launch browser with examples.|
| `npm start` | Launch browser to show the examples. <br> Press `Ctrl + c` to kill **http-server** process. |
=======

## SASS usage

Once you have an `npm start` process initiated, simply add or modify CSS code in `_theme.scss` file, located under the `src/styles` directory. Upon saving the file, changes will show automatically in the browser.
